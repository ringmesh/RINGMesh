# Naming convention

## Avoid one-letter name (M instead of geomodel).
## Use facet (boundary polygon of a cell) and polygon (surface mesh element) in the right context.

# C++ convention

## Prefer defaulted or deleted empty constructors and destructors.
## Prefer c++11 loop syntax when possible.
## Reserve vector capacity or consider using deque.

# About files

## Remove the .orig files
