     * \brief Fills a closed surface mesh with tetrahedra.

     *  needs to be interfaced (e.g., compiling with tetgen support).
     * \param [in,out] M a reference to a mesh
     * \param [in] preprocess if true, the surface mesh is preprocessed
     *  to fix some defects (small gaps and intersections). If preprocess
     *  is set and borders are detected after preprocessing, then the function
     *  returns false. If preprocess is set to false, then the caller is 
     *  supposed to provide a correct set of input constraints (that may have
     *  dangling borders / internal constraints).
     * \param [in] refine if true, inserts additional vertices to improve
     *  the quality of the mesh elements
     * \param[in] quality typically in [1.0, 2.0], specifies
     *  the desired quality of mesh elements (1.0 means maximum
     *  quality, and generates a higher number of elements).
     * \param[in] keep_regions if set, then all internal regions are kept, and
     *  a region cell attribute is created, else only tetrahedra in the outermost
     *  region are kept.
     * \retval true if the mesh was sucessfuly tetrahedralized
     * \retval false otherwise
     * \note needs a constrained Delaunay algorithm to work (geogram needs
     *  to be compiled with mg-tetra or tetgen).
