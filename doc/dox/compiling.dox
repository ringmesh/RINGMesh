\page ringmesh_compiling Instructions for compiling RINGMesh

RINGMesh is tested under Linux (64 bits) and Windows (64 bits).
You will need CMake (version >= 2.8.11). There is no other dependancy (everything
that you need is shipped with RINGMesh). Follow the Linux or Windows instructions below.

Linux
=====

Compiling RINGMesh
------------------

- ./configure.sh
- cd build/ringmesh/Linux64-gcc-Release
- make

This will first configure and compile Geogram 
and then it will generate dynamic libraries.

Compiling the documentation
---------------------------

The documentation can be generated using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) :
- cd doc
- doxygen Doxyfile

Then you can open the doc/html/index.html file in your web browser.

Windows
=======

Jeanne tu peux t'occuper de cette partie stp ?

- start CMake (cmake-gui)
- Where is the source code: <geogram_path>
- Where to build the binaries: <geogram_path>/build/windows
- Push the 'configure' button
- Choose the compiler (32 or 64 bits)
- (and ignore the warning about Doxygen)
- Push the 'generate' button
- Open <geogram_path>/build/windows/Geogram.sln in Visual studio
- Select the 'Release' or 'Debug' (default) configuration (pulldown menu)
- Build the solution (F7)
