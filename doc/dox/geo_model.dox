\page ringmesh_geo_model Description of the GeoModel

@todo Update this page.

The key object of RingMesh is the GeoModel that represents a geological model.

Constitutive elements
------------------------

A model is defined by its constitutive elements:
- The base entities. They define the geometry of the model
    - Regions 3D  
    - Surfaces 2D
    - Lines 1D
    - Corners 0D 

- The geological entities. They are groups of base entities.
    - Layers 
    - Interfaces
    - Contacts

GeoModelEntity and derived classes
---------------------------------

The class RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity is the base class implementing an element of 
the RINGMesh::GeoModel.
It stores the basic required information to describe an element of the model: 
the model owning the element, the index and type of the element, a name, a geological feature,
as well as connectivity information with the other model elements 
(elements in the boundary, elements in which boundary this element is, the parent element, the children elements).
This base class implements the model regions, contacts, interfaces and layers.
Depending on the type of the elements, some of the attributes should not and are not filled.


A RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity is an abstract class 
for the RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity storing a RINGMesh::Mesh.
From it derive RINGMesh::Surface, RINGMesh::Line, and RINGMesh::Corner
that implement methods to operate on meshes of different dimensions.
Meshes of the different element are independent one from another and
shared vertices and edges are duplicated.
At the model level RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshVertices manages a 
global indexing of the vertices of the different meshes.
 
 
 RINGMesh::GeoModelMesh : a global mesh representation of the GeoModel
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The GeoModelMesh is one mesh built from copying and merging the RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity.

 Building a GeoModel
-------------------------------
 
 The class RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilder implements functions to 
 build and modify the elements of a RINGMesh::GeoModel.
 Any new builder should derive from this class.
 Three builders are implemented:
- RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderGocad to load either 
 - a SKUA-GOCAD structural model saved in a .ml (RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderML) file or 
 - a volumetric model saved in a .so (RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderSO) file.
