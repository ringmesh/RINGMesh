\page ringmesh_geo_model Description of the GeoModel

The key object of RingMesh is the GeoModel that represents a geological model.

Constitutive elements
------------------------

A model is defined by its constitutive elements (RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity) that can be derived into several classes:
- The base entities (RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity). They define the geometry of the model
    - Regions 3D  
    - Surfaces 2D
    - Lines 1D
    - Corners 0D 

- The geological entities (RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity). They are groups of base entities according to 
their geological meaning.
    - Layers 
    - Interfaces
    - Contacts
    
- The RINGMesh::Universe that bounds the volume of interest.

The RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity stores the basic required information to identify an element of the RINGMesh::GeoModel: 
- The RINGMesh::GeoModel owning the element.
- The index and type of the element.
- A name.
- A geological feature (fault, horizon...).
- ...

The Geometrical Entities: RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity is an abstract class 
of the RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity. It stores a RINGMesh::Mesh to support the
Geometry of:
- RINGMesh::Region 
- RINGMesh::Surface
- RINGMesh::Line
- RINGMesh::Corner

The low level classes implement methods to operate on meshes according to their dimension.

The Geological Entities: RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity is an abstract class 
of the RINGMesh::GeoModelEntity. It stores the connectivity between RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity
to provide a geological meaning to geometrical entities. It uses a kind of parent/child implementation.
Built-in RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity (sub-classes) in RINGMesh are:
- RINGMesh::Contact. It is the parent of several RINGMesh::Line (children). A RINGMesh::Contact represents
a geological contact, i.e. the intersections between two RINGMesh::Interface (intersection between two
faults or between a fault and a horizon for instance).
- RINGMesh::Interface. It is the parent of several RINGMesh::Surface (children).
A RINGMesh::Interface represents a 2D geological objects such as a fault or a horizon.
- RINGMesh::Layer. It is the parent of several RINGMesh::Region (children). It represents
a geological layer.

It is possible to define other kinds of RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity
by deriving RINGMesh::GeoModelGeologicalEntity.
 
 RINGMesh::GeoModelMesh : a global mesh representation of the GeoModel
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The GeoModelMesh is one mesh built from copying and merging the RINGMesh::GeoModelMeshEntity.

 Building a GeoModel
-------------------------------
 
 The class RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilder implements functions to 
 build and modify the elements of a RINGMesh::GeoModel.
 Any new builder should derive from this class.
 Three main builders are implemented:
- RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderGM to load RINGMesh geological model format
(boundary representation or 3D meshed models).
- RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderGocad to load either:
 - A SKUA-GOCAD structural model saved in a .ml (RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderML) file.
 - A volumetric model saved in a .so (RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderTSolid) file.
- RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderSurfaceMesh and RINGMesh::GeoModelBuilderMesh to build a
RINGMesh::GeoModel from a RINGMesh::Mesh.
