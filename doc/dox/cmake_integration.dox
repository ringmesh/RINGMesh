\page ringmesh_cmake_integration How to integrate RINGMesh in another cmake project

This page explains how to complete a CMakeLists.txt of a project using RINGMesh as dependency.


Define a user-defined variable to get RINGMesh install directory path
-------------------------------------------------------------
The code below defines a variable RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX containing the path to the RINGMesh install directory.
The user can change the default value (parent directory of the current cmake project).
This directory must contain a RINGMeshConfig.cmake file.
If you compiled RINGMesh using Unix Makefiles, RINGMeshConfig.cmake is in build/Debug directory in debug mode
(build/Release in release mode, and build/RelWithDebInfo in release with debug information mode).
If you compiled RINGMesh using a project-based IDE (i.e., Visual Studio and Xcode), RINGMeshConfig.cmake is in the build
directory.

Example with RINGMesh compiled thanks to Unix Makefiles:
\code
set(RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../RINGMesh/build/Release" CACHE PATH "Path to RINGMesh install directory (mandatory dependency)")
\endcode

Example with RINGMesh compiled thanks to Visual Studio or Xcode:
\code
set(RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../RINGMesh/build" CACHE PATH "Path to RINGMesh install directory (mandatory dependency)")
\endcode


Find the RINGMesh cmake configuration file
------------------------------------------
The code below finds the RINGMesh cmake configuration file from the variable RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX
and imports RINGMesh targets in your cmake script.

\code
message(STATUS "Using RINGMesh install directory = ${RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX}")

find_package(RINGMesh REQUIRED PATHS ${RINGMesh_INSTALL_PREFIX})

\endcode


Using RINGMesh with your code
-----------------------------
Add this line to link your library (called MyLib) with RINGMesh libraries (in this example: geomodel_core and geomodel_tools):
\code
target_link_libraries(MyLib RINGMesh::geomodel_core RINGMesh::geomodel_tools)
\endcode
