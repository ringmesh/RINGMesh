\page ringmesh_features RINGMesh Functionalities

Executables
-------------
Several small apps are provided with RINGMesh

 - ringmesh_surface_convert.exe
 File fomat converter for surface objects.  
 Supported input format: Gocad triangulated surface (.ts file). 
 Supported output format: .obj, .mesh, .meshb, .ply, .off, .stl, \link class_g_e_o_1_1_mesh_i_o_handler Geogram in/out handler \endlink).  
 
 - ringmeshconvert.exe
 File format converter for geological models.
 Supported \link ringmesh_file_format "input formats" \endlink.
 Supported \link ringmesh_file_format "output formats" \endlink.
 
 - ringmeshview.exe
 Visualization of geological models.
 
 - ringmeshstats.exe
 Load a GeoModel and print statistics in the command terminal.
 
To use the full possibilities of ringmeshview and override an old graphic card driver,
use the options gfx:GLUP_profile=GLUP150 gfx:GLSL_version=4.3 to specify the version supported by your graphic card.
 
Warning: The apps are built only if the compilation flag RINGMESH_WITH_UTILITIES is TRUE.
The visualization tool is built only if the compilation flag RINGMESH_WITH_GRAPHICS is TRUE.
 
What the API can do
----------------------
You can use RINGMesh as a library and access all functionalities on geological models in your code.

@todo This is quite incomplete. We need sample code there and a more exhaustive list of the main functionalities [JP]
By using this data structure you can:
 - Test the validity of your model: (i.e. RINGMesh::is_geomodel_valid()).
 - Ease the communication between software through various possible in/out formats.
