           gmge_t are used to identify a GeoModelGeologicalEntity (with an index and a type)
      User who want to use GeoModelEntity has now to give a particular attention on which kind on GeoModelEntity
      he is working.
 * EntityType are not a std::string anymore but an abstract class. GeologicalEntityType and MeshEntityType inherit
      from EntityType.
