Major change:
 * Add support of 2D GeoModel:
     * User can use GeoModel2D and GeoModel3D, they follow the same boundary representation design as before
     * Meshes can be defined using only 2 coordinates

New Features:
 * Add support to Mac OS using Clang (Unix Makefile and Xcode project). Works
       with the internal eclipse project.
 * Add import of SVG file for GeoModel2D.
       We only read pathes and they should be flat. There is a command to flatten pathes in Inkscape.
 * Add a GeoModel2D builder from projection of GeoModel3D on a given plane.
 * Add objects to iterate using range-loop like for integers and GeoModelMeshEntities:
       objects are range for integers, region_range for Regions etc.
 * Generic factory:
     * the key is template
     * the instantiated classes can have different constructor arguments (type and number)
 * Use of clang-format to format C++ code
 * Add import of Stradivarius file for GeoModel2D. 

Bug fix:
 * Error in computation of polygon area (for 3D concave polygons)
 * Crash when removing the first object in RINGMeshView object tree
 * Crash when calling mesh entity removal for the second time

Improvements:
 * Include new geogram release 1.4.10
 * Export attributes to TSolid file.
 * Use std::tuple for output only values, these values are no longer taken as parameter.
 * Use of variadic template for RINGMesh Exceptions. Useful to write long description messages
      involving the output of string, double, int etc.
 * Simplify GeoModel io file hierarchy.
 * Add exact predicates into 2d geometric intersections.
 * Convert tinyxml2 and zlib into corresponding hgsub

#### Release: 4.1.0 ####

New Features:
 * New thread safe logger
      Each call to Logger::XXX will output consistently in the console in multithreading environment
      The Logger uses variadic templates, you can use as many parameters as you want in the function.
 * Add possibility to run specific validity check on GeoModels (topology, geometry, all, ...)
 * ASCII surface STL export
 * First implementation of a stratigraphic column
 * Add Feflow export using .fem file. Support wells as discrete fractures and mixed element mesh.
 * Add symmetric entity relationships management, an entity is the boundary of another entity
      and the reverse is automatically set. Same things for the parents/child relation
 * New version of the .gm file format which not contains the GEOL_FEATURE on Mesh Entities anymore.
 * Export to gmsh file format (V2).
 * Add MeshSet, a mesh composed from all the other mesh types (PointSet, Line, Surface and Volume).

Bug fix:
 * Crash when GeoModelMesh was initialized before the GeoModelMeshEntity geometries were set.
 * Cannot delete Mesh in RINGMeshView
 * Fix crash on RINGMeshView exit (Logger was still register)
 * RINGMesh now compiles when TetGen cmake option is set to off
 * GeoModelMeshVertices was not cleared after a tetrahedralize step

Improvements:
 * Refactoring of the io to have smaller files
 * Explicit distinction between the denomination of GeoModelMeshEntity and GeoModelGeologicalEntity:
      Now, gmme_t are used to identify a GeoModelMeshEntity (with and index and a type)
           gmge_t are used to identify a GeoModelGeologicalEntity (with an index and a type)
      User who want to use GeoModelEntity has now to give a particular attention on which kind on GeoModelEntity
      he is working.
 * EntityType are not a std::string anymore but an abstract class. GeologicalEntityType and MeshEntityType inherit
      from EntityType.
 * Remove MeshAllD and inherited classes, user should only use Mesh0D, Mesh1D, Mesh2D or Mesh3D.
      The GeoModelMesh has been modified according this modification.
 * Improve some designs by using the NRVO/RVO (Named Return Value Optimization)
 * Use C++11 smartpointers for all the pointers allocated on the heap
 * Remove complex inheritance design of the GeogramMesh and GeogramMeshBuilder classes
 * Add naming distinction between a facet (a boundary polygon of a cell) and a polygon (a surface mesh element)
 * Mesh Entities have no longer a GEOL_FEATURE.
 * Refactoring of the GeoModel graphics
 * Create enums for classifying cells (CellType) and polygons (PolygonType).
 
Deprecated:
 * Remove support of .ogm
 * Remove support of .mesh and .meshb

Architecture:
 * All third party files (zlib, geogram) are now in a "third_party" directory at the RINGMesh root.
 * Removal of ThreeJS third party.
 * Add formatter settings for Visual Studio 2013 (12.0) and Visual Studio 2015(14.0).
      Formatters are uniform between Visual and Eclipse.
 * A cmake configuration file was created to ease the integration of RINGMesh in other
      software which is generated by cmake.
      This file is cmake/RINGMeshConfig.cmake. See doxygen documentation
      (doc/dox/cmake_integration.dox) for more details.
