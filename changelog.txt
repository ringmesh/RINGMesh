#### Current changeset ####

New Features:
 * New thread safe logger
      Each call to Logger::XXX will output consistently in the console in multithreading environment
      The Logger uses variadic templates, you can use as many parameters as you want in the function.
 * Add possibility to run specific validity check on GeoModels (topology, geometry, all, ...)

Bug fix:
 * Crash when GeoModelMesh was initialized before the GeoModelMeshEntity geometries were set.

Improvements:
 * Refactoring of the io to have smaller files
 * Explicit distinction between the denomination of GeoModelMeshEntity and GeoModelGeologicalEntity:
      Now, gmme_t are used to identify a GeoModelMeshEntity (with and index and a type)
           gmge_t are used to identify a GeoModelGeologicalEntity (with an index and a type)
      User who want to use GeoModelEntity has now to give a particular attention on which kind on GeoModelEntity
      he is working.
 * EntityType are not a std::string anymore but an abstract class. GeologicalEntityType and MeshEntityType inherit
      from EntityType.
 * Remove MeshAllD and inherited classes, user should only use Mesh0D, Mesh1D, Mesh2D or Mesh3D.
      The GeoModelMesh has been modified according this modification.
 * Improve some designs by using the NRVO/RVO (Named Return Value Optimization)
 * Use C++11 smartpointers for all the pointers allocated on the heap
 * Remove complex inheritance design of the GeogramMesh and GeogramMeshBuilder classes 

Deprecated:
 * Remove support of .ogm
 * Remove support of .mesh and .meshb

Architecture:
 * All third party files (zlib, geogram) are now in a "third_party" directory at the RINGMesh root.
 * Removal of ThreeJS third party.
 * Add formatter settings for Visual Studio 2013 (12.0) and Visual Studio 2015(14.0).
      Formatters are uniform between Visual and Eclipse.
