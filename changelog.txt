Bug fix:
 *

Improvements:
 * Refactoring of the io to have smaller files
 * Explicit distinction between the denomination of GeoModelMeshEntity and GeoModelGeologicalEntity:
      Now, gmme_t are used to identify a GeoModelMeshEntity (with and index and a type)
           gmge_t are used to identify a GeoModelGeologicalEntity (with an index and a type)
      User who want to use GeoModelEntity has now to give a particular attention on which kind on GeoModelEntity
      he is working.
 * EntityType are not a std::string anymore but an abstract class. GeologicalEntityType and MeshEntityType inherit
      from EntityType.
 * Remove support of .ogm
 * Remove support of .mesh and .meshb
 * Remove MeshAllD and inherited classes, user should only use Mesh0D, Mesh1D, Mesh2D or Mesh3D.
      The GeoModelMesh has been modified according this modification.
 * Improve some designs by using the NRVO/RVO (Named Return Value Optimization)
